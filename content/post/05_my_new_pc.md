Some thoughts before the purchase:
1. **An mATX casing**  
    prefer a smaller size PC, but not ITX, which is usually poorly ventilated and more restricted to configure
2. **A cost-effective CPU**  
    AMD Ryzen 3000 series is a good option
3. **A budget GPU**  
    I'm not a serious gamer
4. **SSD(Nvme) only**  
    SSD is not way too expensive compared to HDD nowadays
5. **32GB memory**   
    should be more than enough
6. **Adequate and quiet cooling**  
    just don't want my PC to be overheated
