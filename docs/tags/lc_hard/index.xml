      <description>Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
Follow up: The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2] Output: 2.00000 Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2. Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4] Output: 2.50000 Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.</description>

      <description>You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.
Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.
Example 1:
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]] Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6] Explanation: The linked-lists are: [ 1-&amp;gt;4-&amp;gt;5, 1-&amp;gt;3-&amp;gt;4, 2-&amp;gt;6 ] merging them into one sorted list: 1-&amp;gt;1-&amp;gt;2-&amp;gt;3-&amp;gt;4-&amp;gt;4-&amp;gt;5-&amp;gt;6 Example 2:
Input: lists = [] Output: [] Example 2:
Input: lists = [[]] Output: [] Constraints:
 k == lists.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.siwei.dev/leetcode/42-trapping-rain-water/</guid>
      <description>Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
Example 1: Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1] Output: 6 Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5] Output: 9 Constraints:
 n == height.</description>

      <title>123 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III</title>
      <link>https://blog.siwei.dev/leetcode/123-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.siwei.dev/leetcode/123-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/</guid>
      <description>You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
Example 1:
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4] Output: 6 Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.</description>

      <title>295 Find Median from Data Stream</title>
      <link>https://blog.siwei.dev/leetcode/295-find-median-from-data-stream/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.siwei.dev/leetcode/295-find-median-from-data-stream/</guid>
      <description>The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value and the median is the mean of the two middle values.
  For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
  For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5. Implement the MedianFinder class:
  MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.siwei.dev/leetcode/420-strong-password-checker/</guid>
      <description>A password is considered strong if the below conditions are all met:
 It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters. It contains at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit. It does not contain three repeating characters in a row (i.e., &amp;quot;...aaa...&amp;quot; is weak, but &amp;quot;...aa...a...&amp;quot; is strong, assuming other conditions are met).  Given a string password, return the minimum number of steps required to make password strong.</description>
