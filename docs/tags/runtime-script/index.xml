      <description>Creating mini-games is one of the purposes of developing Runtime Script. Although it is not a convenient language to write games, Runtime Script provides the basic features, such as drawing pixels and monitoring key events, for building playable and publishable games.

      <description>In 2016, the year I graduated from my university, I started implementing a scripting language, YJLO Script. It has a modern-style syntax since I borrowed a bunch of ideas from recent popular languages, such as Python, Golang, and Swift. It is implemented in JavaScript and interpreted directly in the browser.
The development process of YJLO Script is fun, I tried to push some commits to the repo very day with no gap for more than half year.</description>
