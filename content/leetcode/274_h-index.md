Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their i<sup>th</sup> paper, return compute the researcher's `h`**-index**.

According to the `definition of h-index on Wikipedia`: A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least h citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`**-index**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total
and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and
the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- n == citations.length
- 1 <= n <= 5000
- 0 <= citations[i] <= 1000

	}

		if count >= i {
