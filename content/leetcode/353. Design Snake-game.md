Design a [Snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)) that is played on a device with screen size `height x width`. [Play the game online](http://patorjk.com/games/snake/) if you are not familiar with the game.

The snake is initially positioned at the top left corner `(0, 0)` with a length of `1` unit.

You are given an array `food` where <code>food[i] = (r<sub>i</sub>, c<sub>i</sub>)</code> is the row and column position of a piece of food that the snake can eat. When a snake eats a piece of food, its length and the game's score both increase by `1`.

Each piece of food appears one by one on the screen, meaning the second piece of food will not appear until the snake eats the first piece of food.

When a piece of food appears on the screen, it is **guaranteed** that it will not appear on a block occupied by the snake.

The game is over if the snake goes out of bounds (hits a wall) or if its head occupies a space that its body occupies after moving (i.e. a snake of length 4 cannot run into itself).

Implement the `SnakeGame` class:

- `SnakeGame(int width, int height, int[][] food)` Initializes the object with a screen of size `height x width` and the positions of the food.
- `int move(String direction)` Returns the score of the game after applying one `direction` move by the snake. If the game is over, return `-1`.
 

**Example 1:**
```

Input
["SnakeGame", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]
[[3, 2, [[1, 2], [0, 1]]], ["R"], ["D"], ["R"], ["U"], ["L"], ["U"]]
Output
[null, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, -1]

Explanation
SnakeGame snakeGame = new SnakeGame(3, 2, [[1, 2], [0, 1]]);
snakeGame.move("R"); // return 0
snakeGame.move("D"); // return 0
snakeGame.move("R"); // return 1, snake eats the first piece of food. The second piece of food appears at (0, 1).
snakeGame.move("U"); // return 1
snakeGame.move("L"); // return 2, snake eats the second food. No more food appears.
snakeGame.move("U"); // return -1, game over because snake collides with border
```

**Constraints:**
- <code>1 <= width, height <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- `1 <= food.length <= 50`
- `food[i].length == 2`
- <code>0 <= r<sub>i</sub> < height</code>
- <code>0 <= c<sub>i</sub> < width</code>
- `direction.length == 1`
- `direction` is `'U'`, `'D'`, `'L'`, or `'R'`.
- At most <code>10<sup>4</sup></code> calls will be made to `move`.
