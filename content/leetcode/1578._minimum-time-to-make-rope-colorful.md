Alice has `n` balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a **0-indexed** string `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the <coce>i<sup>th</sup></code> balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be **colorful**. She does not want **two consecutive balloons** to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it **colorful**. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the <coce>i<sup>th</sup></code> balloon from the rope.

Return *the **minimum time** Bob needs to make the rope **colorful***.


**Example 1:**
```
 B R B B G
 B R   B G

Input: colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: In the above image, 'a' is blue, 'b' is red, and 'c' is green.
Bob can remove the blue balloon at index 2. This takes 3 seconds.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color. Total time = 3.
```
**Example 2:**
```
B R G
B R G

Input: colors = "abc", neededTime = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The rope is already colorful.
Bob does not need to remove any balloons from the rope.
```
**Example 3:**
```
B B R B B
  B R B

Input: colors = "aabaa", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Bob will remove the ballons at indices 0 and 4.
Each ballon takes 1 second to remove.
There are no longer two consecutive balloons of the same color.
Total time = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

**Constraints:**
- `n == colors.length == neededTime.length`
- <code>1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
- <code>1 <= neededTime[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- `colors` contains only lowercase English letters.
